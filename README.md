# Slang - The Programming Language

## Rationale

The idea for this programmig language is to combine Python's flexibility and other programming languages' common features.

## "Foreign" Python Features

- #### Value and Variable distinctionns (*val* and *var*)

**val** value = ... (*value* **cannot** be rassigned)

**var** variable = ... (*variable* **can** be reassigned)

- #### Semi-Colons (*;*) and Curly Braces (*{*, *}*)

Both **actions** and **blocks** should be clearly depicted.
This means the endings of lines, and the beginning and endings of code blocks. Indentation is *optional*, but it is of course good practice to indent inside code blocks.

- #### *abstract* keyword for functions, values, and variables

Anything abstract must be defined inside of a class, but does **not** need implementation."abstract" must preceed the function, value, etc. Any class that inherits from a class with abstract members **must** define them.

- #### TODO
